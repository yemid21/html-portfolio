<h1>The Best Movies According to Yemi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Joker (2019)</h3>
<p>
  This is my favourite movie of all time. It shows how difficult it is to be a
  sane in an otherwose insane world. How difficult it is to maintain sanity and
  how easy it is to descend to the pits of madness. It also shows societies role
  in ostrising the mentally unwell.

<h3>The Batman (2022)</h3>
<p>
  This is my favourite on-screen representation of The Batman. He was broody,
  dark and intense. I loved every minute of it. Gotham itself was its own
  character.
</p>

<h3>Life (1999)</h3>
<p>
  The journey of two black men and their wrongful incarceration. It explores
  themes of frienship, betrayal and philosophy.
